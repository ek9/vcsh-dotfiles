vcsh-dotfiles
=============

[vcsh-dotfiles][0] aims to simplify the bootstrap procedure of managing your
dotfiles with [vcsh][1]. It sets up [vcsh][1], [mr][2], adds usable hooks and
lays down simple directory that vcsh repositories can follow.

It is inspired by the bootstrap script in [vdemeester/vcsh-home][3] repository.
You can check [ek9/dotfiles][10] for various repositories that use
[vcsh-dotfiles][0].

## Features

- Automatically download and setup `vcsh` and `mr` by fetching files via
  curl/wget and git.
- Sets up `.local/bin` for local binaries and shell scripts (added to `PATH`)
- [vcsh][1] hooks setup to:
    - Enable sparse checkout.
    - Ignore `README`, `LICENSE` and other common development files.
    - Make backup copies of files that would be overwritten when cloning.
    - Repositories can have `.gitignore` files stored
      in `.gitignore.d/<repo-name>` of every repository
- [mr][2] `.mrconfig` setup to source files in:
    - `.config/mr/config.d` (for [vcsh][1] repositories)
  This allows any repositories to extend `mr` configuration further.
